                            <ul>• This is a fantastic course. I was completely lost on how to start and now I
                                know how...still have many things to learn and would like to be admitted in
                                some other edition</ul><br>
                            <ul>• This is a very important course delivered with excellence. I would strongly
                                recommend it to beginners, mid-career scholars as well as those who would
                                like to know the cutting edge issues in SR and MA. Particularly, I would
                                strongly recommend it to nearly all scholars across Africa and beyond</ul><br>
                            <ul>• This course is comprehensive and elaborate, well taught with practical
                                examples. The group work was especially very instrumental in understanding
                                the course work, giving opportunity to better integrate what's being learned
                                into practice.</ul><br>
                            <ul>• I spent years looking for training on SR and MA. Being accepted to
                                participate was like a dream come true. The best part was that the teacher
                                offered his time and devotion free of charge to empower African researches.
                                Well done, …I definitely recommend this training.</ul><br>
                            <ul>• This is a signature course for any serious epidemiologist or public health
                                professional. This a new advancement in research methodology which I

                                Epidemiology is the foundation of population and public health sciences.Its
                                contribution to detection and prevention of diseases and promotion of health
                                cannot be over-estimated. Epidemiology has developed into a science with its own
                                methods and tools to achieve success. However, often many researchers in the
                                health sciences run into varied challenges because of deficit in grasping the
                                methods of epidemiology and application of these in their research work. New
                                challenges and concepts emerge during the research process. Finding the
                                solutions to the encountered problems is not always hands-on. Issues concerning
                                decision on the right study design, right statistical techniques, and dealing
                                with biases in analysis are a few of occurring dilemma. This course takes
                                participants through the science of epidemiology. At the end of the course,
                                participants will be stimulated into deeper appreciation and grasp of
                                epidemiologic methods in the scientific research process. Teaching of the course
                                includes seminars, workshops, and analysis of specific cases, with the aim of
                                providing participants with the skill-sets required to deal with similar
                                situations in their own research domains. Issues covered in the course include.</p>

                                During the last half century, many misconducts have been documented in scientific
                                research: several published papers have been retracted as a result of outright
                                fraud, data manipulation, data theft, and other negative practices. The core
                                tenets of the scientific research processes are not always upheld by many
                                researchers. However, during the past decade, the field of reproducible research
                                has been gaining popularity and is being embraced across many scientific
                                research fields. Reproductivity refers to the ability of an investigator to
                                duplicate the results of a prior study using the same methods as were used by
                                the original investigator. Its overarching goal is to revive excellence in
                                scientific research. Reproductivity requires specific tools and skill-sets at
                                each stage of the research process, but these are not widely known by many
                                researchers. The need to continue to teach the benefits and processes of
                                Reproductivity in science is fundamental. This course covers the landscape of
                                Reproductivity in scientific research, focusing particularly on issues of
                                Reproductivity in the medical field. The course provides participants with the
                                practical tools and algorithms required for the implementation of
                                Reproductivity in their own research work. Several case studies are analyzed in
                                order to appreciate the various aspects of the field of reproducible research.
                                Tutoring is participatory, with hands-on practical sessions that will allow
                                participants to implement the skill-sets learned. The course is suitable for
                                postgraduate students, junior and senior researchers from any field of research.
                                The course covers the following main themes.</p>

                            <p>• Fundamental principles of scientific research and its benefits to the society

                                The world and everyday activities we engaged in have become
                                ongoing data repository that benefit scientific research. Research data are
                                emanating from different angles, increasing in both depth and complexity.
                                Analysis of research data to make sense of them and inform key decisions for the
                                society, for medical care, and for policy, can be perplexing for many
                                researchers. At the same time, the computer software to analyze data have also
                                grown in number, and choosing relevant software to analyze data can be
                                challenging for many researchers. This course takes participants step-by-step
                                through the process of planning and analyzing their research-generated data and
                                interpreting results emanating from their analyses. During the course, a couple
                                of software will be introduced to demonstrate how the different data analyses
                                can be implemented across software. Tutoring is hands-on, allowing participants
                                to implement the skill-sets learned. The course is suitable for postgraduate
                                students, junior and senior researchers from any field of research.</p>

                                Academic publishing remains the bedrock for assessing
                                scientific productivity. In recent decades, the pressure to publish has led to
                                production of poor scientific papers that do not provide meaningful contribution
                                to growth of knowledge. The exponential growth in academic journals, many of
                                which are ‘predatory’ in that their only motivation is to make money, has led to
                                lousy publication of scientific works. Such journals end up publishing almost
                                anything submitted to them, without the usual careful checks and balances and
                                critical peer reviewing processes that have been the foundation of the
                                scientific process. Many academicians, given the pressure to publish, have
                                usually fallen victim of this below par scientific publishing. Adding to the
                                challenges is that many scientists have not learned the overarching goal of
                                academic publishing and the processes and strategies to achieve success.
                                Academic publishing requires certain skills that every scientist needs to learn.
                                Unfortunately, such skills have usually not been part of the mainstream
                                curricula training of scientists. Many scientists then end up growing in their
                                publishing career through trial and error or through collaborative networks,
                                which usually are not available to all researchers. This course takes
                                participants into the world of academic publishing, focusing primarily on
                                journal publishing. The course covers issues around: thinking of a scientific
                                paper, developing the structure of a scientific paper, writing a scientific
                                paper, going through the publication process of a scientific paper, and dealing
                                with reviewers and editorial criticisms of the scientific paper. The overarching
                                goal of the course is to help participants become successful in their scientific
                                publishing career, ensuring that they communicate and disseminate their
                                scientific findings in a way that contributes to the growth of knowledge and
                                gain positive impact on the society. The course is suitable for postgraduate
                                students, junior and senior researchers from any field of research.</p>

                                in the form of grants to scientists. Without these contributions to scientific
                                research, the success of science will be deficient. Usually, scientists have to
                                apply and compete to receive these funds in order to perform their scientific
                                works. While many scientists have been successful in obtaining research grants,
                                thus achieving impressive milestones in their careers, others have been less
                                successful. As with success in scientific publishing, success with securing
                                research grants is an important aspect of a successful scientific career.
                                However, for many scientists, especially those who are young in their scientific
                                career, knowing how to be successful in securing funding for their research
                                projects remains challenging. Often the questions are asked: what are the
                                sources of grants to apply?; how do I write a successful grant application? This
                                course answers these questions and many more and provides participants with the
                                tools required to identify the appropriate sources to apply for research grants.
                                Importantly, regardless of the grant source, the course guides participants
                                through writing a successful grant application. The course is suitable for
                                postgraduate students, junior and senior researchers from any field of research.</p>
